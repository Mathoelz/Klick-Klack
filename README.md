# Klick-Klack
A 3D-Game for two players based on the roll-a-ball principle!

## Description

This project was conducted by the students Mathias HÃ¶lz & Maxim Zitnikowski during the 4th semester of studying computer
science with a focus on media. For the development of this game ideas have been used from the beginner roll-a-ball project.
Afterwards the project was expanded to create a multiplayer game. Instead of racing each other to reach the goal, the players are connected by a rope that limits movement and can be used to move obstacles, so they have to work together to achieve victory!
